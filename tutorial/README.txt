* Project:      Assignment 0: Unix/Python Tutorial
*
* Description:
*   This assignment purpose was to help me get familiar with
*   Python and the Unix basics.
*
*   Q1: addition.py
*       Need to return a value instead of 0 all the time.
*       Modified the return 0 to be return a+b. After running
*       autograder.py in the terminal I now see how the tests are
*       ran
*
*   Q2: buyLotsOfFruit.py
*       Need to go through the list and return the cost of the list (fruit,pound).
*       Did a for loop to go through list. Did if statement to check if fruit name
*       is on the list. If so, find the fruit cost and multiply the fruit weight.
*       Then return the total cost. If fruit is not on the list, print an error
*       message and return None.
*
*   Q3: shopSmart.py
*       Need to return the fruit shop name where the order cost was the least
*       amount in total. Set a variable with infinity large value where we will
*       store the cheapest cost. Set a shop name in cheapestShop variable. Did a
*       for loop to go through the list. Get the cost and store that value. Compare
*       that value to the cheapest cost variable. If the new cost is cheaper, then
*       switch the values and also the shop names.Continue to compare all the costs.
*       When done, return the cheapest shop name.
*       *** New to Python. Just found out there is a min function. Will learn how to
*       use that for the future***
